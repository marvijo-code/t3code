# Claude

T3 Code uses Claude Code's login and configuration. Start with the default provider
for one account; [provider setup](./install.md#providers) covers installation and
shared provider settings.

## Separate accounts or configurations

Use a separate Claude config directory for each account. This also works for named
presets that need different Claude settings or a router connection.

Keep your existing account in the default directory. On the environment's machine,
create the second login:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude_personal
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude_personal claude auth login
```

Add another Claude instance in **Settings > Providers**:

| Instance        | Binary path | CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR path |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Claude Work     | `claude`    | Leave empty            |
| Claude Personal | `claude`    | `~/.claude_personal`   |

An empty config-directory setting uses Claude Code's normal configuration. The
custom setting changes `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, leaving `HOME` and the system keychain
location intact. Use the same variable for the login command. Setting `HOME`
instead can put credentials where this provider will not find them.

Check the account reported in provider settings after signing in. Existing
threads can switch only between Claude instances with the same config directory.
Separate account directories stay isolated, including their local conversation
state. Claude does not have Codex's shared-home and shadow-home arrangement.

For presets that differ only in API keys or endpoints, use the instance's
**Environment variables**. Variable assignments do not belong in **Launch arguments**.

Claude Code's verbose mode can stay enabled when you use Claude for text generation, including
thread titles, branch names, commit messages, and pull request descriptions. On a remote connection,
T3 Code uses the Claude configuration on the connected server.

## Compact long conversations

Set **Auto-compact after** in the Claude provider settings to an integer between
`100000` and `1000000`. For example, `300000` asks Claude to summarize at about
300,000 tokens. This changes when compaction happens, not the model's context
window. Leave it empty for Claude Code's default.

You can also send `/compact` in an existing conversation. Web and desktop offer
**Compact context** from the context meter and may suggest it when you return to
a large older thread. See [commands and skills](./composer.md#commands-and-skills)
for using composer commands.

## Usage limits

If your Claude subscription runs out of usage mid-turn, the thread shows which
limit was reached and the remaining wait when Claude provides a reset time.
Claude Code holds the turn until that window reopens, so it can keep showing as
working. Wait for the reset, or stop the turn and continue later. The warning's
timestamp shows when the displayed wait started.

## Skills

Claude skills come from the config directory's `skills` folder and the project's
`.claude/skills` folder. If both define the same name, the config-directory copy
wins. Skills disabled in Claude's settings do not appear in the composer.

Use `$` in the composer to select a skill. Skills marked `disable-model-invocation`
can still be started by you. Invoke those one per message: Claude directly runs
only the last named skill and may try to start earlier ones through its Skill
tool, which refuses skills reserved for manual invocation.

## OpenRouter

In **Settings > Providers > OpenRouter**, save your OpenRouter API key on the execution
environment, test the connection, and enable **Use OpenRouter for Claude Code**. Select
**OpenRouter (Claude Code)** and an OpenRouter model when starting a thread. The environment
still needs the `claude` executable installed. Model compatibility depends on Claude Code
and OpenRouter; a successful key test does not guarantee every model works.

Setup is per connected environment. The key stays on that server and is shared by the
three OpenRouter harness switches. Removing the key turns all switches off. Key and switch
changes reconnect the affected harness; thread history is retained. Separate custom
instances with their own environment variables remain available for advanced setups.

## Other routers

A local router uses an ordinary Claude provider instance. Give it a separate
config directory and put the router's endpoint and credential variables in that
instance's **Environment variables**. The router must run where the environment
can reach it. Follow the [Claude Code Router instructions](https://github.com/musistudio/claude-code-router)
for its installation and routing configuration.
